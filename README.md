Assignment 01

To follow the requirements of a Ball Throwing-like game following the city living theme, I decied to have the user play soccor in a field located in a city. I was able to find free models of city buildings, roads, ect to help me build a city enviorment. I tried to make the field look like it was located in the city park, but I couldn't find any good chainlink fences to help me create the right enviornment. I had to stick to a wooden fence design to keep the ball inside the field. I've seen parks in our city get renovations or work done so there are traffic cones in the field the user can knock down to score a goal. 

I ran into some last minute issues uplading the output game files and the files needed for the editor. Because of this my game is missing some models seen in the demo if opened in the unity editor.
